ch1%4%With this volume we begin what may be called the second part of the Survey. All that has preceded it has dealt with the history of London as a whole; now we turn to London in its topographical aspect and treat it street by street, with all the historical associations interwoven in a continuous narrative with a running commentary of the aspect of the
streets as they were at the end of the nineteenth century, for the book is strictly a Survey of London up to the end of the nineteenth century. (public domain)
